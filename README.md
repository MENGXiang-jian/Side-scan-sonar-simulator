# Side scan sonar simulator

【Side scan sonar simulator】——completely open source and free to use. https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/6/3083

The START.m script file is the root file of the whole simulator, where the user inputs simulation parameters. The simulator provides a complete simulation process of conventional single beam side scan sonar, and can be grafted and expanded if necessary.

【Introducation】: Side scan sonar (SSS) is a multi-purpose ocean sensing technology, but due to the complex engi-neering and variable underwater environment, its research process often faces many uncertain obstacles. Sonar simulator can provide reasonable research conditions for guiding development and fault diagnosis, which simulates the underwater acoustic propagation and sonar principle to restore the actual experimental scenarios. However, the current open-source sonar simulators gradually lag behind the mainstream sonar technology, so they cannot afford sufficient assistance, especially the low computational efficiency and unsuitable high-speed mapping simulation. This paper presents a sonar simulator based on a two-level network architecture, which has flexible task scheduling system and extensible data interaction organization. Echo signal fitting algorithm proposes a pol-yline path model to accurately capture the propagation delay of the backscattered signal under high-speed motion deviation. The large-scale virtual seabed is the operational nemesis of the con-ventional sonar simulators, then a modeling simplification algorithm based on a new energy func-tion is developed to optimize the simulator efficiency.

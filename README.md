# Side scan sonar simulator

【Side scan sonar simulator】——completely open source and free to use. 

The START.m script file is the root file of the whole simulator, where the user inputs simulation parameters. The simulator provides a complete simulation process of conventional single beam side scan sonar, and can be grafted and expanded if necessary.

（If you have any questions about the application, you can contact the developers at any time. Welcome to communicate and make progress together!）

【Introducation】: Side scan sonar (SSS) is a multi-purpose ocean sensing technology, but due to the complex engi-neering and variable underwater environment, its research process often faces many uncertain obstacles. Sonar simulator can provide reasonable research conditions for guiding development and fault diagnosis, which simulates the underwater acoustic propagation and sonar principle to restore the actual experimental scenarios. However, the open-source sonar simulators gradually lag behind the mainstream sonar technology, so they cannot afford sufficient assistance, especially in the high-speed mapping technology and future research scalability. This paper presents a sonar simulator based on a two-level network architecture, which can adapt to acoustic signal simulation of various sensor arrays at high-speed and the extensible data interaction network. Echo signal synthesis algorithm proposes a continuous motion model to accurately capture the time delay of the response signal under the planning migration curve. The large-scale virtual seabed is the operational nemesis of the conventional sonar simulator, so a modeling simplification algorithm based on the modified energy function is developed to optimize the acoustic scanning process. This paper arranges several virtual seabed to test the above simulation algorithm, and finally compares the lake experiment results to prove the feasible of this sonar simulator.
